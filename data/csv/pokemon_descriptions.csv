energy, this Pokémon also loves to eat berries.
In the daytime, it curls up in the grass to sleep."
166,28,9,"In battle, it throws punches with all four arms.
The power of each individual blow is piddly,
so it aims to win by quantity rather than quality."

ensnared in its
nest of spunstring, it waits
motionlessly until
it becomes dark."

strong, it’s potent enough to weaken prey that
gets caught in its web."

using wings that barely make a sound.
This POKéMON rests by hanging on atree branch with its rear legs that
serve as wings."

it can’t move well on the ground. All it can do
is crawl around."
169,28,9,"Silent and swift in its four-winged flight, it bites
down on its prey before they realize what’s
happening. In a heartbeat, it drains their blood."
169,29,9,"Its fangs are so sharp, if it bites you in the dark
and sucks your blood, you won’t notice any pain
or realize you’ve been bitten."

Pokémon. If it can’t drink any blood for even a
short while, it becomes weak and unable to fly."

their environment and diet. There are many of
them at beaches where the waves are calm."

where it leaves behind a sticky trail of slime as it
passes through."
423,34,9,"The softness of its body helps disperse the force
of impacts, so although its body is uncommonly
squishy, it’s also surprisingly resilient."

with its two tails. It rarely uses
its arms now."

426,33,9,"Some say this Pokémon is a collection of souls
burdened with regrets, silently drifting through
the dusk."
426,34,9,"It grabs people and Pokémon and carries them
off somewhere. Where do they go?
Nobody knows."
427,12,9,"It slams foes by sharply uncoiling
its rolled ears. It stings enough
to make a grown-up cry in pain."
427,13,9,"When it senses danger, it perks up
its ears. On cold nights, it sleeps
with its head tucked into its fur."
427,14,9,"Its ears are always rolled up. They
can be forcefully extended to
shatter even a large boulder."
427,15,9,"You can tell how it feels by the way

427,29,9,"Its arms and legs are weak, but when it rolls its
ears up tight and then unleashes them with its
full force, it can smash boulders to dust."
427,30,9,"The reason it keeps one ear rolled up is so it
can launch a swift counterattack if it’s attacked
by an enemy."
427,33,9,"If both of Buneary’s ears are rolled up, something
is wrong with its body or mind. It’s a sure sign the
Pokémon is in need of care."
427,34,9,"Buneary can attack by rolling up their ears and
then striking with the force created by unrolling
them. This attack becomes stronger with training."

It cloaks its body with its fluffy
ear fur when it senses danger."

428,29,9,"Lopunny regrows its coat twice a year. Mufflers
and hats made from its fur are really warm."
428,30,9,"It’s notably wary and has a dislike of fighting,
but at the same time, it can deliver powerful
kicks with its lithe legs."
428,33,9,"Lopunny is constantly monitoring its surroundings.
If danger approaches, this Pokémon responds
with superdestructive kicks."
428,34,9,"Once hot seasons are over, Lopunny’s coat will
be replaced with fur that holds a lot of insulating
air in preparation for colder weather."
429,12,9,"Its cries sound like incantations.
Those hearing it are tormented
by headaches and hallucinations."

usually torment targets, some
chants bring happiness."

incantations, placing curses, and giving
people terrifying visions."
429,28,9,"Mismagius have been known to cast spells to
make people fall in love, so some people search
for this Pokémon as if their life depended on it."
429,29,9,"Feared for its wrath and the curses it spreads,
this Pokémon will also, on a whim, cast spells
that help people."
429,30,9,"Its muttered curses can cause awful headaches
or terrifying visions that torment others."
430,12,9,"Becoming active at night, it is
known to swarm with numerous
MURKROW in tow."
430,13,9,"It makes its MURKROW cronies
bring it food. It idles its time
away, grooming itself in its nest."
430,14,9,"If one utters a deep cry, many
MURKROW gather quickly. For this,
it is called “Summoner of Night.”"
430,15,9,"It is merciless by nature. It is said

will assemble."

or if it feels they have betrayed it, it will hunt
them down wherever they are and punish them."
430,29,9,"It will absolutely not forgive failure from or
betrayal by its goons. It has no choice in this
if it wants to maintain the order of the flock."
430,30,9,"Its goons take care of most of the fighting for it.
The only time it dirties its own hands is in
delivering a final blow to finish off an opponent."
431,12,9,"It claws if displeased and purrs
when affectionate. Its fickleness
is very popular among some."
431,13,9,"With its sharp glare, it puts
foes in a mild hypnotic state.
It is a very fickle Pokémon."
431,14,9,"It hides its spiteful tendency of

look like it’s crying—apparently an effective way

and carefully copies the Mr. Rime’s steps
like an apprentice."

when it’s eating a good dream, and black when
it’s eating a nightmare."
518,17,9,"The mist emanating from their foreheads
is packed with the dreams of people
and Pokémon."
518,18,9,"With the mist from its forehead,

518,33,9,"When dark mists emanate from its body, don’t
get too near. If you do, your nightmares will
become reality."
518,34,9,"It drowses and dreams all the time. It’s best to
leave it be if it’s just woken up, as it’s a terrible
grump when freshly roused from sleep."
519,17,9,"Each follows its Trainer’s orders as
best it can, but they sometimes fail to
understand complicated commands."

If you’re scattering food for them, be careful—
several hundred of them can gather at once."
519,34,9,"It’s forgetful and not very bright, but many
Trainers love it anyway for its friendliness
and sincerity."
520,17,9,"It can return to its Trainer’s location
regardless of the distance
separating them."
520,18,9,"Many people believe that, deep in the

524,27,9,"Born deep within the ground, it compares itself
with similar species, such as Geodude and
Carbink, to settle which has the hardest body."
524,28,9,"The hexagonal cavity is its ear. It walks in the
direction of sounds it hears, but if the sounds
cease, it panics and topples over."
524,29,9,"The hexagonal hole is its ear. Deep in that ear is
an energy core, so if you stick your hand in
there, Roggenrola will be very angry!"
524,30,9,"It was found in a fissure in a layer of exposed
rock. The material that makes up its body is
dirt from several hundred years ago."
524,33,9,"It’s as hard as steel, but apparently a long soak in
water will cause it to soften a bit."
524,34,9,"When it detects a noise, it starts to move.
The energy core inside it makes this Pokémon
slightly warm to the touch."
525,17,9,"When it overflows with power,
the orange crystal on its body glows.
It looks for underground water in caves."
525,18,9,"Because its energy was too great to be
contained, the energy leaked and formed
orange crystals."
525,21,9,"When it is healthy, its core sticks out.

Just one crystal fragment would provide

water. It’s not comfortable around water, so

turned into orange crystals that are hard
enough to smash diamonds."
525,30,9,"Its orange crystals are lumps of powerful
energy. They’re valuable, so Boldore is

wary. It’s about to fire off bursts of energy."
525,34,9,"It relies on sound in order to monitor what’s in its
vicinity. When angered, it will attack without ever
changing the direction it’s facing."
526,17,9,"Compressing the energy from its
internal core lets it fire off an attack
capable of blowing away a mountain."
526,18,9,"The solar energy absorbed by its body’s
orange crystals is magnified internally
and fired from its mouth."
526,21,9,"The solar rays it absorbs are
processed in its energy core
and fired as a ball of light."

526,26,9,"Compressing the energy from its internal core
lets it fire off an attack capable of blowing away
a mountain."
526,27,9,"The blasts of energy it makes from sunbeams
have terrifying power. However, it’s not able to
fire its blasts at night or on rainy days."
526,28,9,"Known for its hefty horsepower, this Pokémon
is a popular partner for construction workers."
526,29,9,"When it fires off energy with all its might, the
power creates countless fissures on its body."
526,30,9,"It absorbs rays of sunlight and shoots out
energy. It’s usually lurking deep beneath
the surface."
526,33,9,"This hardy Pokémon can often be found on
construction sites and in mines, working
alongside people and Copperajah."
526,34,9,"Although its energy blasts can blow away
a dump truck, they have a limitation—
they can only be fired when the sun is out."
527,17,9,"Its habitat is dark forests and caves.
It emits ultrasonic waves from its
nose to learn about its surroundings."
527,18,9,"Suction from its nostrils enables it to
stick to cave walls during sleep. It
leaves a heart-shaped mark behind."
527,21,9,"The heart-shaped mark left on a body

527,33,9,"While inside a cave, if you look up and see lots
of heart-shaped marks lining the walls, it’s
evidence that Woobat live there."
527,34,9,"It emits ultrasonic waves as it flutters about,
searching for its prey—bug Pokémon."
528,17,9,"It emits sound waves of various
frequencies from its nose, including
some powerful enough to destroy rocks."

528,33,9,"Emitting powerful sound waves tires it out.
Afterward, it won’t be able to fly for a
little while."
528,34,9,"The auspicious shape of this Pokémon’s nose
apparently led some regions to consider
Swoobat a symbol of good luck."
529,17,9,"It can dig through the ground
at a speed of 30 mph. It could give
a car running aboveground a good race."

Gurdurr. If it fails to measure up to the other
Pokémon, it lies low for a little while."

537,26,9,"They shoot paralyzing liquid from their head bumps.
They use vibration to hurt their opponents."
537,33,9,"The vibrating of the bumps all over its body
causes earthquake-like tremors. Seismitoad and
Croagunk are similar species."
537,34,9,"This Pokémon is popular among the elderly,
who say the vibrations of its lumps are great
for massages."

stronger. Wild Throh use vines to weave
their own belts."

538,33,9,"It performs throwing moves with first-rate skill.
Over the course of many battles, Throh’s belt
grows darker as it absorbs its wearer’s sweat."
538,34,9,"They train in groups of five. Any member that
can’t keep up will discard its belt and leave
the group."
539,17,9,"The sound of Sawk punching boulders
and trees can be heard all the way from
the mountains where they train."
539,18,9,"Tying their belts gets them pumped and
makes their punches more destructive.
Disturbing their training angers them."

they seclude themselves in
mountains and train without sleeping."

539,33,9,"If you see a Sawk training in the mountains in its
single-minded pursuit of strength, it’s best to
quietly pass by."
539,34,9,"The karate chops of a Sawk that’s trained itself
to the limit can cleave the ocean itself."
540,17,9,"Leavanny dress it in clothes they made
for it when it hatched. It hides its head
in its hood while it is sleeping."
540,18,9,"This Pokémon makes clothes for itself.
It chews up leaves and sews them with
sticky thread extruded from its mouth."

541,17,9,"Forests where Swadloon live have superb
foliage because the nutrients they make
from fallen leaves nourish the plant life."

to paralyze large bird Pokémon that try
to prey on it."
543,18,9,"It discovers what is going on around it
by using the feelers on its head and tail.
It is brutally aggressive."

543,33,9,"Venipede and Sizzlipede are similar species,
but when the two meet, a huge fight ensues."
543,34,9,"Its fangs are highly venomous. If this Pokémon
finds prey it thinks it can eat, it leaps for them
without any thought of how things might turn out."
544,17,9,"Protected by a hard shell, it spins
its body like a wheel and crashes
furiously into its enemies."
544,18,9,"It is usually motionless, but when
attacked, it rotates at high speed and
then crashes into its opponent."

545,33,9,"Scolipede latches on to its prey with the claws on
its neck before slamming them into the ground
and jabbing them with its claws’ toxic spikes."
545,34,9,"Scolipede engage in fierce territorial battles with
Centiskorch. At the end of one of these battles,
the victor makes a meal of the loser."
546,17,9,"When attacked, it escapes by shooting
cotton from its body. The cotton serves
as a decoy to distract the attacker."
546,18,9,"They go wherever the wind takes them.
On rainy days, their bodies are heavier,
so they take shelter beneath big trees."
546,21,9,"Perhaps because they feel more at ease
in a group, they stick to others they
find. They end up looking like a cloud."

they stick to others they find. They end up looking
like a cloud."
546,27,9,"When it finds others of its kind, they all stick
together. When enough of them have collected,
the mass resembles a cumulonimbus cloud."
546,28,9,"Pillows and beds stuffed with cotton exhaled
by Cottonee are soft and puffy, light and airy—
altogether top quality."
546,29,9,"To protect itself, it shoots cotton from its body.
When it gets wet in the rain, its cotton grows
moist and heavy, and it can’t move as well."
546,30,9,"When attacked, it expels cotton from its
body to create a diversion. The cotton it loses
grows back in quickly."
546,33,9,"It shoots cotton from its body to protect itself.
If it gets caught up in hurricane-strength winds,
it can get sent to the other side of the Earth."

and Eldegoss produces exquisite cloth that’s
highly prized by many luxury brands."

no matter how small. It leaves balls of white
fluff behind."
547,27,9,"It rides on the wind and slips into people’s
homes. After it has turned a room into a cotton-
filled mess, it giggles to itself and takes off."
547,28,9,"This Pokémon appears, riding upon the wind.
But if the wind gusts up, it’ll blow the cotton on
this Pokémon’s head clean off."
547,29,9,"This nuisance sneaks into people’s homes,
where it hides important things and scatters
cotton all over the place."
547,30,9,"Whimsicott doesn’t live in a fixed location. It
floats around on whirling winds, appearing all
over the place to perform its mischief."
547,33,9,"It scatters cotton all over the place as a prank. If
it gets wet, it’ll become too heavy to move and
have no choice but to answer for its mischief."
547,34,9,"As long as this Pokémon bathes in sunlight, its
cotton keeps growing. If too much cotton fluff
builds up, Whimsicott tears it off and scatters it."
548,17,9,"The leaves on its head are very bitter.
Eating one of these leaves is known
to refresh a tired body."
548,18,9,"Since they prefer moist, nutrient-rich
soil, the areas where Petilil live are
known to be good for growing plants."
548,21,9,"The leaves on its head grow right back
even if they fall out. These bitter
leaves refresh those who eat them."

enough to cause dizziness, they provide relief
from weariness—even more so when boiled."
548,28,9,"By pruning the leaves on its head with
regularity, this Pokémon can be grown into a
fine plump shape."
548,29,9,"Some say if you dry the leaves on its head, boil
them down, and drink the infusion, your vigor
will return, so Petilil is popular with the elderly."
548,30,9,"They prefer clean water and soil. When the
environment they live in turns bad, the whole
bunch will up and move to a new area."
548,33,9,"Petilil appears around sources of clean water.
Boiling leaves from this Pokémon’s head results in
a liquid that’s sometimes used as a bug repellent."
548,34,9,"The deeper the color of a Petilil’s leaves, the
healthier the Pokémon is. Petilil sometimes makes
its home in a well-tended field or flowerbed."
549,17,9,"Even veteran Trainers face a challenge
in getting its beautiful flower to bloom.
This Pokémon is popular with celebrities."
549,18,9,"The fragrance of the garland on its head

raising it, its flowers are the most beautiful
when they bloom in the wild."
549,28,9,"As soon as it finds a male to be its partner,
the beautiful flower on its head darkens,
droops, and withers away."
549,29,9,"The fragrance of its flower differs slightly
depending on the soil where it grew up.
Sniffing the aroma calms your heart and mind."
549,30,9,"It’s well liked by other Pokémon because of its
beauty. The flower on its head needs constant
care, or it will soon wither and rot."
549,33,9,"It’s believed that even first-rate gardeners have a
hard time getting the flower on a Lilligant’s head
to bloom."
549,34,9,"Essential oils made from Lilligant flowers
have a sublime scent, but they’re also
staggeringly expensive."
550,17,9,"Red and blue Basculin get along so
poorly, they’ll start fighting instantly.
These Pokémon are very hostile."
550,18,9,"Red and blue Basculin usually do not

are always fighting each other over territory."
550,30,9,"When a school of Basculin appears in a lake,
everything else disappears, except for Corphish
and Crawdaunt. That’s how violent Basculin are."
550,33,9,"Anglers love the fight this Pokémon puts up on
the hook. And there are always more to catch—
many people release them into lakes illicitly."
550,34,9,"In the past, it often appeared on the dinner
table. The meat of red-striped Basculin is on the
fatty side, and it’s more popular with the youth."
551,17,9,"They live buried in the sands of the
desert. The sun-warmed sands prevent
their body temperature from dropping."
551,18,9,"It moves along below the sand’s surface,

The sun-warmed sands prevent their body
temperature from dropping."
551,27,9,"It submerges itself in sand and moves as if
swimming. This wise behavior keeps its enemies
from finding it and maintains its temperature."
551,28,9,"It conceals itself in the sand and chomps down
on the legs of any prey that unwarily walk over
it. Its favorite food is Trapinch."
551,29,9,"Alola, where it’s warm all year round, is a
comfortable environment for this Pokémon.
Sometimes you’ll even see it outside of deserts."
551,30,9,"Sandile’s still not good at hunting, so it mostly
eats things that have collapsed in the desert.
It’s called “the cleaner of the desert.”"
551,33,9,"The desert gets cold at night, so when the sun
sets, this Pokémon burrows deep into the sand
and sleeps until sunrise."

powerful. Pushing sand aside as it goes, Sandile
moves through the desert as if it’s swimming."

A female is often the leader of the group, and
the males will gather food."

eyes, it can see its surroundings clearly, even in
the middle of the night."
552,29,9,"Krokorok really hates it when its body gets
cold. On nights when the temperature drops,
it digs deep into the desert sands."

emergency meals when its hunts
are unsuccessful."
552,33,9,"Krokorok has specialized eyes that enable it to
see in the dark. This ability lets Krokorok hunt in
the dead of night without getting lost."

much at night—the desert gets cold after sunset."

553,27,9,"Its unique faculty of sight can detect small prey
more than 30 miles away, even in the midst of
a sandstorm."
553,28,9,"After clamping down with its powerful jaws,
it twists its body around to rip its prey in half."
553,29,9,"When it spots prey, even at a distance of over
30 miles, it swims through the desert as if it
were water, then jumps out and chomps them."
553,30,9,"It conceals itself in sandstorms that Flygon
whip up and waits patiently for prey to appear."
553,33,9,"This Pokémon is known as the Bully of the Sands.
Krookodile’s mighty jaws can bite through heavy
plates of iron with almost no effort at all."

the patience to stay hidden under sand for days,
lying in wait for prey."

cannot calm down and it runs around.
When the fire diminishes, it falls asleep."

its body. If the fire dwindles, this Pokémon will
immediately fall asleep."
554,34,9,"This popular symbol of good fortune will never
fall over in its sleep, no matter how it’s pushed
or pulled."
555,17,9,"Its internal fire burns at 2,500° F,
making enough power that it can
destroy a dump truck with one punch."

are no suitable rocks to be found, Dwebble may
move in to the ports of a Hippowdon."

say they were the guardians of an ancient city.
Others say they were the guardians’ emissaries."
561,34,9,"A discovery was made in the desert where
Sigilyph fly. The ruins of what may have been
an ancient city were found beneath the sands."

the prey cornered, another would swoop on it."

so if anyone other than an experienced
professional tries to restore it, they will fail."

muscles it uses to flap its wings are still weak,
so it needs a long runway in order to take off."

wants to fly, it first needs to run nearly 25 mph,

apparently better at hunting on the ground."

right arm. If even a little of it gets on you, you’ll
experience the effects of the unidentified toxin."

in Alola. Since the arrival of Grimer, their
population has decreased dramatically."
569,29,9,"It locks opponents in place with its left hand,
immobilizing them by entirely dousing their
bodies with poisonous liquid."

little stronger than their counterparts elsewhere

570,30,9,"If a normally talkative child suddenly stops
talking, it may have been replaced by Zorua."

to be what led to the development of Zorua’s
ability to take on the forms of other creatures."

kind, and it will conjure terrifying illusions to

can still be heard making a muted cry. Many believe

because if you have an Alomomola with you,
there’ll be no need for a doctor or medicine."

condition is that any Pokémon coming after
them may also attack Alomomola."

territory. They challenge foes with tusks that can
cut steel."

steel beams. These Pokémon are covered in
hard armor."

dirt to take in the minerals it needs to keep its
tusks in top condition."
612,34,9,"While usually kindhearted, it can be terrifying if
angered. Tusks that can slice through steel beams
are how Haxorus deals with its adversaries."
613,17,9,"When it is not feeling well, its mucus
gets watery and the power of its
Ice-type moves decreases."
613,18,9,"Its nose is always running. It sniffs the
snot back up because the mucus
provides the raw material for its moves."

becomes thicker and stickier. It will smear its snot
on anyone it doesn’t like."
613,34,9,"It sniffles before performing a move, using its
frosty snot to provide an icy element to any
move that needs it."

Very able in the water, it swims around
in northern seas and catches prey."

fangs and claws of ice to fight with.

From its frozen breath, it forms icy fangs that
are harder than steel."
614,34,9,"It swims energetically through frigid seas.
When it gets tired, it freezes the seawater
with its breath so it can rest on the ice."
615,17,9,"When its body temperature goes up, it
turns into steam and vanishes. When its
temperature lowers, it returns to ice."
615,18,9,"They are born in snow clouds.
They use chains made of
ice crystals to capture prey."

615,33,9,"With its icy chains, Cryogonal freezes those it
encounters. It then takes its victims away to
somewhere unknown."
615,34,9,"When the weather gets hot, these Pokémon turn
into water vapor. Cryogonal are almost never
seen during summer."
616,17,9,"When attacked, it defends itself by
closing the lid of its shell. It can spit
a sticky, poisonous liquid."
616,18,9,"It evolves when bathed in an
electric-like energy along with
Karrablast. The reason is still unknown."

616,26,9,"It evolves when bathed in an electric-like energy
along with Karrablast. The reason is still unknown."
616,33,9,"When attacked, it tightly shuts the lid of its shell.
This reaction fails to protect it from Karrablast,
however, because they can still get into the shell."
616,34,9,"It has a strange physiology that responds to
electricity. When together with Karrablast,
Shelmet evolves for some reason."
617,17,9,"When its body dries out, it weakens.
So, to prevent dehydration, it wraps
itself in many layers of thin membrane."

foes. Featuring Accelgor as a main character is
a surefire way to make a movie or comic popular."
617,34,9,"Discarding its shell made it nimble. To keep
itself from dehydrating, it wraps its body in
bands of membrane."
618,17,9,"Its skin is very hard, so it is unhurt
even if stepped on by sumo wrestlers.
It smiles when transmitting electricity."
618,18,9,"It conceals itself in the mud of the
seashore. Then it waits. When prey touch
it, it delivers a jolt of electricity."
618,21,9,"When its opponent can’t be paralyzed,
it contorts itself with unexpected speed
and flops away."

it, this Pokémon developed the organs it uses to
generate electricity."
618,34,9,"For some reason, this Pokémon smiles slightly
when it emits a strong electric current from the
yellow markings on its body."
619,17,9,"In fights, they dominate with onslaughts
of flowing, continuous attacks. With
their sharp claws, they cut enemies."
619,18,9,"They have mastered elegant combos.
As they concentrate, their battle moves
become swifter and more precise."

619,29,9,"They can often be seen in packs in the morning,
slowly moving their bodies through a series
of poses."
619,30,9,"They seclude themselves in the mountains and
devote themselves to training. The form of their
kicks and chops differs from pack to pack."
619,33,9,"In one minute, a well-trained Mienfoo can chop
with its arms more than 100 times."
619,34,9,"Though small, Mienfoo’s temperament is fierce.
Any creature that approaches Mienfoo carelessly
will be greeted with a flurry of graceful attacks."
620,17,9,"It wields the fur on its arms like a whip.
Its arm attacks come with such rapidity
that they cannot even be seen."
620,18,9,"They use the long fur on their arms
as a whip to strike their opponents."

620,29,9,"It overwhelms its opponents with continuous
attacks and then slowly stores up power
before delivering the finishing blow."
620,30,9,"When Mienshao lets out a bizarre wail, you’re in
danger. A flurry of kicks and chops too fast to
see is about to be unleashed!"
620,33,9,"When Mienshao comes across a truly challenging
opponent, it will lighten itself by biting off the
fur on its arms."
620,34,9,"Delivered at blinding speeds, kicks from this
Pokémon can shatter massive boulders into
tiny pieces."
621,17,9,"It warms its body by absorbing sunlight
with its wings. When its body temperature
falls, it can no longer move."
621,18,9,"It races through narrow caves, using

on its face is harder than a rock."

621,29,9,"The red skin on its face is harder than rock.
In narrow caves, it squares off against its
enemies and charges face-first right into them."
621,30,9,"It infiltrates tunnels that Pokémon like Diglett
and Dugtrio have dug and quietly waits for prey
to pass through."
621,33,9,"Druddigon lives in caves, but it never skips
sunbathing—it won’t be able to move if its body
gets too cold."
621,34,9,"Druddigon are vicious and cunning. They take up
residence in nests dug out by other Pokémon,
treating the stolen nests as their own lairs."

622,29,9,"Its movements are powered by a mysterious
energy. It has continued to move since ancient
times, so its power may soon run out."
622,30,9,"Although ancient people apparently built it by
working with clay, the source of its energy
is unclear."
622,33,9,"They were sculpted from clay in ancient times.
No one knows why, but some of them are driven
to continually line up boulders."
622,34,9,"This Pokémon was created from clay. It received
orders from its master many thousands of years
ago, and it still follows those orders to this day."
623,17,9,"It flies across the sky at Mach speeds.
Removing the seal on its chest makes
its internal energy go out of control."

623,29,9,"Some say that ancient people invented Golurk
to serve as a laborer. It follows its master’s
orders faithfully."
623,30,9,"When the seal on its chest is removed, it rages
indiscriminately, turning the whole town around
it into a mountain of rubble."
623,33,9,"Artillery platforms built into the walls of ancient
castles served as perches from which Golurk
could fire energy beams."
623,34,9,"There’s a theory that inside Golurk is a perpetual
motion machine that produces limitless energy,
but this belief hasn’t been proven."
624,17,9,"Blades comprise this Pokémon’s entire
body. If battling dulls the blades, it
sharpens them on stones by the river."
624,18,9,"They fight at Bisharp’s command.

on a stone by the river. Each Pawniard has its
own favorite sharpening stone."
624,30,9,"It follows Bisharp’s orders to a tee when it
attacks enemies. After slashing an opponent,
Pawniard clangs both of its blades together."
624,33,9,"It uses river stones to maintain the cutting edges
of the blades covering its body. These sharpened
blades allow it to bring down opponents."
624,34,9,"A pack of these Pokémon forms to serve a
Bisharp boss. Each Pawniard trains diligently,
dreaming of one day taking the lead."
625,17,9,"It leads a group of Pawniard.
It battles to become the boss, but will
be driven from the group if it loses."

that if the blade on its head is chipped, it will
retire from its position as the boss."
625,30,9,"It leads a group of Pawniard. Bisharp doesn’t
even change its expression when it deals
the finishing blow to an opponent."
625,33,9,"It’s accompanied by a large retinue of Pawniard.
Bisharp keeps a keen eye on its minions, ensuring
none of them even think of double-crossing it."
625,34,9,"Violent conflicts erupt between Bisharp and
Fraxure over places where sharpening stones
can be found."
626,17,9,"Their fluffy fur absorbs damage,
even if they strike foes with a
fierce headbutt."
626,18,9,"They charge wildly and headbutt
everything. Their headbutts have enough

than a headbutt. Bouffalant with more hair on
their heads hold higher positions within the herd."

individuals. Bouffalant that betray the herd will
lose the hair on their heads for some reason."

They bravely stand up to any opponent,

stronger and more powerful each time they
faint or are injured."
627,28,9,"With its sharp claws, this Pokémon pierces its
prey, and then it pecks at them. Although it also
consumes berries, it’s a carnivore at heart."
627,29,9,"With its powerful legs and sturdy claws, it can
crack even the hard shells of Shellder and pluck
out their insides."
627,30,9,"Known as a natural-born warrior, soon after its
hatching, it will challenge its parent to a fight in
order to gain their acceptance."
627,33,9,"If it spies a strong Pokémon, Rufflet can’t resist
challenging it to a battle. But if Rufflet loses,
it starts bawling."
627,34,9,"A combative Pokémon, it’s ready to pick a fight
with anyone. It has talons that can crush
hard berries."
628,17,9,"They fight for their friends without any
thought about danger to themselves.

628,27,9,"With its brave disposition, it fears nothing—not
even death. Ancient Alolan people respected
it, referring to it as “the hero of the sky.”"
628,28,9,"It’s thought that people disturbed their habitats
in the past, so Braviary banded together to
fight back."
628,29,9,"The more scars it has on its front, the more
heroic it’s considered to be. Those with many
scars on their back are mocked by the flock."
628,30,9,"Known as “the hero of the skies,” this
Pokémon is so proud and so brave that it will
never retreat, even when it’s injured."

Pokémon is often seen as a motif for various

629,27,9,"It protects its plump posterior with the bones
of prey it has consumed. As it grows, it 
replaces the bones."
629,28,9,"It can’t fly yet and must wait until its wings have
developed more. Since it’s still at a playful age,
it hops around friskily."
629,29,9,"Mandibuzz gives it the bones it wears. Vullaby’s
wings are short, so it can’t fly yet, but it jumps
